How Feature-Based Attention Tracks Violations of Prior Belief
Based On Laquitaine DataSet https://github.com/steevelaquitaine/projInference


Background:
Perceptual decision-making is shaped by the integration of prior expectations and sensory evidence. Laquitaine and Gardner (2018) introduced a motion direction estimation task in which human participants combined noisy visual stimuli with directional priors. While previous analyses have focused on the influence of prior expectations, the potential role of feature-based attention (e.g. alignment, color, shape) has not been explored.

Objective:
This study investigates whether feature-based attention to alignment of dot motions as a mediator variable contributes to estimation error, beyond the influence of prior beliefs about motion.

Methods:
We performed a secondary analysis on the Laquitaine dataset, comprising over 83,000 trials from 12 participants. Trial-wise prediction error was modeled using statistical methods that incorporated both prior belief and feature-based attention effects.

To ensure that the observed correlation was not merely a reflection of proximity to the prior belief, we conducted a control analysis on trials where the feature index varied in the opposite direction of the prior. In these trials, we observed a strong positive correlation between alignment which is our selected feature and performance, suggesting the effect is not confounded by prior beliefs.


Expected Results:
We hypothesize that a stronger effect of feature-based attention will be associated with lower observed prediction error in a meaningful and consistent way.

Implications:
Our findings suggest that in perceptual decision-making, feature-based attention is a contributor of the estimation error. This highlights the importance of accounting for feature-based mechanisms in experimental design and computational modeling to avoid biased interpretations of behavior.
